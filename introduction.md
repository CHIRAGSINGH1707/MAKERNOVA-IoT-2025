Hello Everyone!

I'm Kashish Nakar, a second-year Electrical Engineering student at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), Surat, originally from Kutch, Gujarat. I’m deeply passionate about electronics and hands-on innovation, especially in the field of embedded systems and IoT.

As a member of the IoT & Embedded Systems domain under Drishti’s Makernova 3.0, I’m excited to work with microcontrollers like ESP, STM32, and Arduino, and to explore sensor interfacing and communication protocols such as I2C, MQTT, and ESP-NOW.

With a hands-on approach to learning, I’m eager to contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with my team, and grow as an embedded systems enthusiast.
