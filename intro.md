Helllo Everyone !
I’m Urja Mandali,
Currently pursuing my second year of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Sardar Vallabhbhai NAtional Institute of Technology,Surat.
I'm originally from Gandhinagar,Gujarat.
I’m part of Drishti’s IoT & Embedded Systems domain for Makernova 3.0, 
where I’m eager to explore and learn about microcontrollers (ESP, STM, Arduino), sensor interfacing, Proteus simulation, and communication protocols like I2C, MQTT, and ESP-NOW.
With a strong interest in hands-on learning, I’m enthusiastic about building, simulating, and contributing to innovative tech projects alongside my team.
